#### 2 - Aquire the following parts

* **1 40-pin "IDE" male-female extension cable, 4 inch length**  
 It needs to be an extension, with one male and one female connector.  
 The direction the cable exits the connector on the *male* end matters. The cable should go *away* from the key notch in the side of the connector.  
 No extra fold / strain relief clip on the male connector.  
 No special requirements for the female connector.

#### 3 - Assembly
Unplug the CF reader from the mainboard & remove the CF card(s) from the reader.

Remove the 4 nylon stand-offs from the screw holes on the mainboard.

Plug the male end of the IDE extension cable onto the CF reader.

Lay the CF reader flat in the small tray formed into the corner of the top_cover, with the lights and jumpers up facing you.  
Install the retainer over top of the CF reader. (refer to pics)

Orient the top cover so that the network, vga, & power side is away from you.  
Set the mainboard standing up behind the 2 rear screw posts, network/vga/power side down.  

Connect the free end of the IDE extension cable to the IDE plug on the mainboard.

Lift the mainboard up from behind the 2 rear screw posts, tip forward toward yourself, and lay the mainboard flat atop all 4 screw posts.

Place the bottom cover on top of the mainboard, with the 4 short risers pointing down.

Install the 4 screws.
